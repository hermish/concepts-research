## Survey-Four
Experiment were participants were shown only the topic of each questions, and were first asked to make the following judgements:

1. How curious are you to know about the question and its answer?
2. How popular do you think this question is in this social forum?

For each participant, half the questions were randomly chosen to have high up-vote numbers (mean: 2405), while the remainder were symmetrically given very low up-vote numbers (mean: 24). In the second phase, we then asked them to reveal the question and answer to exactly five of the questions they saw during the experiment.

## Survey-Five
In this experiment, participants were shown the full text of the questions, and asked to make a more complete set of judgements:

1. How curious are you to know about the question and its answer?'
2. How confident are you that you know the correct answer to this question?
3. To what extent would knowing the answer to this question be useful to you in the future?
4. How popular do you think this question is in this social forum?
5. How well-written do you think this question is?
6. How surprised are you by the popularity of this question?
7. To what extent would knowing the answer to this question be useful to you in a social setting?'

Each participant was place into one of two groups, either upvote information was presented, or it was hidden. For the participants in the experimental group, half the questions were randomly chosen to have high up-vote numbers, similar to the previous experiment.

In the second phase, again, we then asked them to reveal the answers to exactly five of the questions they saw during the experiment.

## Survey-Six
The survey was a control to examine whether giving information about question views induced a similar effect on participants. To pilot the effect, we eliminated phase two, so now we only ask questions and ask participants to make judgements:

1. How curious are you to know about the question and its answer?
2. How popular do you think this question is in this social forum?
3. How many people, relatively, viewed this question?

## Survey-Seven
The survey was a control to examine whether giving participants an arbitrary number had a similar effect. We gave each question a post number and asked them to rate:

1. How curious are you to know about the question and its answer?
2. How popular do you think this question is in this social forum?

## Survey-Eight
This survey was a rehash of our original results, this time with standardized wording and controls. We randomly assign participants to three groups:
1. original experiment with upvote information given;
2. number control where post number is presented; and
3. clean control where only the questions themselves are given.

This was nearly identical to our original experiment, so in phase I participants were asked to making the following Likert scale ratings.

1. How curious are you to know about the question and its answer?'
2. How confident are you that you know the correct answer to this question?
3. To what extent would knowing the answer to this question be useful to you in the future?
4. How popular do you think this question is in this social forum?
5. How well-written do you think this question is?
6. How surprised are you by the popularity of this question?
7. To what extent would knowing the answer to this question be useful to you in a social setting?'

In the second phase, we then asked them to reveal the answers to exactly five of the questions they saw during the experiment. Notice that the corresponding additional information, such as upvote information, or post number, was given as well.

## Survey-Nine
This is identical to the eighth experiment, although now 50% of participants take the survey with upvote information, while the remaining half is split between the two controls.
