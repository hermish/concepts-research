literals.consentPage =  '# Adult Consent Form\n\n**Title of Research:** *Explanation and Understanding*\n\n**Principal Investigator:** Tania Lombrozo\n\n**Principal Investigator\'s Department:** *Psychology*\n\n\nYou are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not clear or if you need more information.\n\n## Purpose of the research:\nThis study is designed to test hypotheses about the nature of people\'s intuitive theories about the world, how they can be changed, and how they influence judgments and behavior. We also hope to learn about how you conceptually understand the world around you. Our intuitive sense of everyday objects and events in the world play a significant role in our thoughts and behaviors, and we wish to understand the nature of human cognition.\n\n## Study Procedures\nYou may be asked to do one or more of the following tasks 1) causal learning tasks (e.g., figuring out what causes what), 2) social tasks (e.g., reasoning about othersâ€™ minds and behavior), 3) linguistic tasks (e.g., word associations and learning), 4) imagination tasks (e.g., reasoning about events counter to fact), 5) categorization\/association tasks (e.g., grouping objects or stating what comes to mind given a prompt), 6) general cognitive tasks (e.g., impulse control and searching for hidden objects). You may be asked to make judgments about what you see, answer multiple choice or open-ended questions about your judgments (such as making predictions and providing explanations), observe events, and perform actions yourself (such as grouping objects). Sometimes you might watch a short video clip, look at pictures, or listen to music, and you may be asked to answer questions about how the clip or music made you feel.\n\nYour total expected time commitment for this study is: *10 minutes and you will be paid $1.40 for your participation.*\n\nPlease only take part in this study if you have not done this study before. *If you have taken part in this study before please do not accept the HIT and return the HIT*\n\n## Benefits and Risks\nThere are no direct benefits to you as a participant, but this research will help us understand various cognitive processes, which may benefit society in a number of ways, including influencing legal and public policy.\n\nRisks associated with participation in this study are minimal. You may feel slight discomfort answering some questions, but you may refrain from answering any questions that make you uncomfortable and may withdraw your participation at any time even after completing the experiment without penalty.\n\n## Confidentiality\nWe will not be asking for any personally identifying information, and we will handle responses as confidentially as possible. Worker IDs will never be tied to your responses on this survey. However, we cannot guarantee the confidentiality of information transmitted over the Internet. To minimize this risk, data containing anything that might be personally identifiable (e.g. Worker IDs or IP addresses) will be encrypted on transfer and storage and will only be accessible to qualified lab personnel. We will be keeping data collected as part of this experiment indefinitely. This anonymized data (containing neither Worker IDs nor IP addresses) may be shared with the scientific community or with other participants to be used as stimuli in future studies.\n\n## Compensation\nFor your participation, you will receive *$1.40.* If you are on MTurk and for any reason you do not complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop), we will only be able to pay you if you send an email through MTurk, or by emailing the researcher, Rachit Dubey, at rdubey@princeton.edu. If you have any questions about the study, feel free to contact Rachit Dubey or the Principal Investigator, Tania Lombrozo, at lombrozo@princeton.edu.\n\n## Who to contact with questions\n\n1. Principal Investigator:\n\t- Tania Lombrozo\n\t- Email: lombrozo@princeton.edu\n\nIf you have questions regarding your rights as a research subject, or if problems arise which you do not feel you can discuss with the Investigator, please contact the Institutional Review Board at:\n\n1. Assistant Director, Research Integrity and Assurance\n\t- Phone: (609) 258-8543\n\t- Email: irb@princeton.edu\n\n---\n\nI understand the information that was presented and that:\n\n- My participation is voluntary, and I may withdraw my consent and discontinue participation in the project at any time. My refusal to participate will not result in any penalty.\n- I do not waive any legal rights or release Princeton University, its agents, or you from liability for negligence.\n\nI hereby give my consent to be the subject of your research.\n';
