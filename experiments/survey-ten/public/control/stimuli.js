                'WASHINGTON — Former President Barack Obama formally announced on Monday a multiyear production deal with Netflix in which he and the former first lady, Michelle Obama, will produce television shows and films for the streaming service.\n\nThe deal will give Mr. Obama an international television platform during his post-presidency, allowing him to reach millions of people in the United States and internationally. The couple has created “Higher Ground Productions,” a company to produce content for Netflix, the streaming service announced.\n\nThe former president has told associates that he does not intend to use the new platform to wage a public campaign against his successor in the Oval Office, or to fight against conservative voices that populate media outlets like Fox News.\nInstead, a release from Netflix said the Obamas will produce “scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries and features” that highlight issues and themes the president pursued during his eight years in office.\n\n“One of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many fascinating people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience,” Mr. Obama said in a statement. “That’s why Michelle and I are so excited to partner with Netflix — we hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world.”\n\nMr. Obama has remained largely quiet since leaving office about a year-and-a-half ago, despite calls from some of his supporters to be more active in fighting back against Mr. Trump’s assault on the Obama legacy.\n\nThe former president and his advisers have rejected that approach, believing that Mr. Obama would become a convenient political target for the current president. As a result, the Netflix deal is unlikely to be a vehicle for any sharp, partisan rhetoric by the former president, officials said.\n\nWord of negotiations between Mr. Obama and Netflix was first reported in The New York Times in March. Netflix did not disclose financial details of the arrangement, though similar deals between streaming services and high-profile celebrities have been worth many tens of millions of dollars over several years.\n\nTed Sarandos, the chief content officer for Netflix, said the deal will benefit the service’s audience.\n\n“Barack and Michelle Obama are among the world’s most respected and highly recognized public figures and are uniquely positioned to discover and highlight stories of people who make a difference in their communities and strive to change the world for the better,” he said. “We are incredibly proud they have chosen to make Netflix the home for their formidable storytelling abilities.”',
                'The Million Cat Challenge is a shelter-based campaign to save the lives of 1 million cats in North America over the course of five years. The core strategy of the campaign is centered around five key initiatives that offer every shelter, in every community, practical choices to reduce euthanasia and increase live outcomes for shelter cats.\n\n1. Alternatives to intake\n2. Managed Admission\n3. Capacity for care\n4. Removing barriers to adoption\n5. Return to field\n\nCat lovers have plenty to celebrate! The Million Cat Challenge has reached its goal of saving a million shelter cats in five years a year ahead of schedule.\n\nAfter more than 1,000 animal shelters in North America joined forces to save the animals, the campaign announced last week that it has exceeded that number just four years after the campaign’s launch. As of December 31, 2017, the shelters collectively saved a total of 1,148,129 cats.\n\n“It would be hard to overstate how much this milestone means to cats and shelters in North America,” the challenge’s co-founder Dr. Kate Hurley of the UC Davis Koret Shelter Medicine Program said in a press release. “We have complete baseline data for 1,075 animal shelters, and when you compare the year prior to the beginning of the Challenge to 2017 numbers, we saw the live release rate rise from 53 percent to 81 percent.”\n\nHurley added: “We just proved the impossible, possible. Possible because shelters and communities of all types and sizes across North America worked together to make it happen.”\n\nThe campaign’s aim was to reach its goal by decreasing feline euthanasia rates, and they have gone down by 63 percent since the Million Cat Challenge was established in 2014. The campaign was launched with funding from Maddie’s Fund, which focuses on protecting companion animals.\n\n“That’s not just a million cats, but a million more cats saved than ever before, thanks to Maddie. What started as a seemingly audacious goal has snowballed into a movement that can change the face of animal sheltering forever,” co-founder Dr. Julie Levy said.\n\nThe campaign focused on five key initiatives to help shelters reach their goals in their communities. The initiatives included providing positive alternatives to keep cats in homes or the communities, helping them provide humane care in the shelters, making sure each shelter has the personnel necessary to care for the animals, making adoption easier, and sterilizing and vaccinating the cats before setting them free to reduce the population.\n'

                'COPENHAGEN—In Denmark, where I live, the flimsy, single-use bags known from many countries are a rarity, only seen at the odd local greengrocer or fishmonger. Supermarkets sell large, durable plastic carrier bags, made to last, to encourage people to use them more than once.\n\nIn 1993 Denmark was the first country to introduce a tax on plastic bags. Today, a bag costs roughly 50 cents, part of which goes in taxes, but the supermarket also makes a small profit. The higher cost of bags has cut the sale of multiple-use bags by more than 40 percent over the past 25 years. On average, a Dane now uses 70 multiple-use carrier bags and just four single-use bags a year, or less than 1.5 plastic bags a week in all. (Compared to the average American who uses nearly one single-use bag a day).\n\nAll parties do agree on one thing: Whatever type of bag you use, you are doing the environment a favor by using it until it is thoroughly worn out. (See how people make only one jar of trash a year.)\n\n**Closing the Circle**\n\nBut what to do with the bags once they are worn out? In this country some bags are sorted as plastic waste and recycled. But many end their existence as garbage bags, incinerated with the rest of the waste.\n\nIn one effort to change this, the large supermarket chain Netto, which operates about 1,300 stores in northern Europe, is adding what amounts to 8 US cents to the price of each plastic carrier bag. For every bag that is returned, the customer will be refunded 1 Danish kroner (16 cents). For every sold bag that is not returned, Netto will donate 1 kroner to WWF to aid their efforts at removing plastic from nature and limiting plastic pollution around the world. Initially, the pilot project is limited to one Danish region, but if successful, Netto may expand the system to all its stores in several countries. Sweden is testing similar initiatives with a bag refund system.\n\nAnd the Danish population seems supportive. According to a TNS Gallup poll last year, 68 percent replied that a refund system for plastic bags (with a deposit added to the current price) is a good idea. Only 13 percent were opposed. So, there might be half a solution for my future stash of plastic bags: I can dole them out to my son as extra pocket money, and he can return them when he returns our empty bottles.',
                'In 2016, 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics, up from 1.6% in 2011. But that compared with 6.5% for boys in 2016 and 44% of schools in England still send no girls at all to study the subject.\n\nThe IoP said physics-based skills were essential for many future careers, from artificial intelligence to aerospace. However, the gender balance at physics A-level in England\'s schools has changed little in decades, with only 20% being female.\n\n\"There is no evidence to suggest any intrinsic differences in ability or interest to explain why girls and boys choose technical subjects differently,\" said IoP President, Prof Dame Julia Higgins. \"The consequences of girls\' choices at school are that many rewarding and fulfilling routes are closed off to them.\"\n\n**Snapshot**\n\nThe report, Why Not Physics? - A Snapshot of Girls\' Uptake at A-level, found only 1.9% of girls chose A-level physics in 2016, compared with 6.5% of boys. In 2011, 1.6% of girls chose the subject, compared with 6.1% of boys.\n\nIn contrast, 8% of girls and 12.3% of boys progressed to maths A-level. In subjects such as English and psychology, the trend is reversed, with far more girls than boys choosing the subjects. The report makes a number of recommendations:\n\n- Schools should routinely monitor by gender the numbers of students progressing to physics A-level\n- They must make serious efforts to address problems where they exist and challenge gender stereotypes and unconscious biases\n\nThe IoP is hosting a summit on Thursday to tackle gender inequality in the classroom and to debate new ways to close the gender gap in the take-up of physics A-level. \"Women in physics are still in the minority, and this lack of visibility preserves the myth and cements the fact that physics is simply not a subject for girls.\"\n\n**Skills Gap**\n\nThe lack of girls studying physics to a higher level also had consequences for the UK economy, the report said. Physics-based skills are required in many growth areas, from aerospace to artificial intelligence, and thousands more workers need to be trained every year to keep the UK economy competitive. A recent P study found that closing the gender gap in physics would take hundreds of years, given the current rate of progress. \n\nResearch analyzing the names of authors listed on millions of scientific papers found physics, computer science, maths and chemistry had the fewest women, while nursing and midwifery had the most.\n\nWithout further interventions, the gender gap was likely to persist for generations, said scientists from the University of Melbourne. Forecasts suggest it will take a very long time to close the gender gap in some fields, with predictions of 320 years for nursing, 280 years for computer science, 258 years for physics and 60 years for mathematics.',
