        "body": "Former army sniper here. There are several reasons you have a spotter. One is that ideally all the shooter should have to do is trigger pull, so you need someone to spot hits and give adjustment to get on target or where the next target is. The second is that rifle optics have a relatively narrow field of view compared to binoculars or a spotting scope, so the spotter has a better overall picture of what is going on. This also frees up the spotter to do secondary activities like calling up Intel reports and calling for fire. Finally you would never send a soldier into the field alone, so you may as well augment there abilities with some of similar skill set.  \nEdit: an addendum to what I am seeing in the comments, the spotter is almost always the more experienced of the two, but not always the better shooter, as their emphasis is on target designation and quick correction which are skills developed over time.

It typically is based on prominent features, things like a signpost, a turn in the road, etc. So in an engagement the spotter is typically reading off data from the range card while the shooter is looking at that through the scope or making adjustments to the settings on the scope's turrets (thus minimizing the amount of guesswork in aligning your crosshairs.)  \n\nSpotters are also 'sanity checks' to confirm a sniper's assessment of distance, or math-check a calculation. They may be using a laser rangefinder while the sniper is engaged with the rifle. While a sniper can at one level just be 'some guy with a gun' - a well trained sniper team is able to adapt to dynamic and changing conditions and deliver first-round accuracy with much greater precision. I suppose it is like a pit crew: one guy could change tires and fill gas but an Indy500 crew can do all of it in a few seconds.\n\n\nAnother important part of being a spotter is watching your own perimeter. If you have ever snuck up on a sniper in an FPS you realize how they become tunnel-visioned looking thru a scope. The spotter will typically have something more carbine-esque that is suitable for dealing with patrols or people who sneak up on snipers.  Just a couple parts of the big picture, hope it helps.",

While a sniper can at one level just be &#39;some guy with a gun&#39; - a well trained sniper team is able to adapt to dynamic and changing conditions and deliver first-round accuracy with much greater precision. I suppose it is like a pit crew: one guy could change tires and fill gas but an Indy500 crew can do all of it in a few seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Another important part of being a spotter is watching your own perimeter. If you have ever snuck up on a sniper in an FPS you realize how they become tunnel-visioned looking thru a scope. The spotter will typically have something more carbine-esque that is suitable for dealing with patrols or people who sneak up on snipers.  Just a couple parts of the big picture, hope it helps.</p>\n</div>",

        "body": "Hi, speech and swallowing therapist here. A mix of good  and off-the-wall answers in the thread. I wanted to add a bit of anatomy to clarify.\n\nYour airway and esophagus are right next to each other. They are separated by a teeeny bit of tissue. Both start at the back of your throat, below the base of your tongue. It's almost like there is a floor that has 2 holes in it, right next to each other. \n\nWhen we talk about the airway, it's useful to break it into 2 parts: upper and lower. The dividing line betweeen upper and lower is your  voice box, aka your vocal cords. You can find those by finding your Adam's Apple (even women have a small one). Your vocal cords are just onthe other side of that bump. \n\nYour upper airway (voice box and above) is very sensitive. When stuff goes down the wrong way and it feels stuck in your throat, it's in this area. Drinking water can remove stuff in this area and flush it into the esophagus where it's supposed to go.\n\nYour lower airway (below your vocal cords, including trachea and tubes that go down to your lungs) is not very sensitive. Have you ever seen someone with a tracheostomy tube? There is a tube in their trachea and it doesn't hurt! The trachea is made of cartilage. It doesn't have a lot of blood supply or nerves. So you really don't feel stuff in your trachea.\n\n**TL; DR When you think you are feeling something in your trachea, it really isn't in your trachea. It's way higher up.**\n\nHope this clarifies a little. And I'm happy to answer any other questions about breathing and swallowing. It's literally my job.\n\nedit: changed a few words about the quality of other responses because i realized a lot of answers in this thread were really wacky! No we don't get hydrated because water passes over our cells. Our throat cells stay moist because of mucus. Lots of mucus.  \n\n**Edit 2: I'm getting a lot of PMs and questions about your personal swallowing and speech issues. Keep in mind I can't diagnose or treat you over the internet.  Also, a lot of folks wanting to know if they should get professional help for their medical issues. The rule of thumb is if an medical issue is affecting your life and makes you change how you're living, then it's time to get treatment. If your swallowing problem is making you too embarrassed to eat in public, or you have to avoid eating certain foods - GET HELP. If your speech problem is keeping you from getting or keeping a job, or makes you anxious to talk in public - GET HELP. Talk to your doctor and ask for a referral to a speech therapist. We're here to help. We're just way more effective in person.**\n\n",

        "body": "In order for venom to be dangerous, it must enter the bloodstream.  Many venomous toxins specifically target red blood cells themselves and break down those cells which results in organs being unable to receive oxygen.  This leads to inflammation and necrosis of the cell tissues.  Organ failure then leads to death.  (Not all venom works this way.  Sometimes venom attacks the nervous system instead.)\n\nWhen consuming anything, animals have several defense mechanisms in the digestive system.  The first defense is the mouth itself.  If the lips start burning, the animal might not swallow.  Then, the taste buds help the predator know whether this should be swallowed if it tastes bad.  Next, the saliva in the mouth and chewing action helps break down molecules and foods into smaller pieces.  Saliva is also full of white blood cells (leukocytes) that attack harmful items (such as bacteria) that might enter your mouth.\n\nAfter the mouth, the item enters the stomach.  The acids, heat, and enzymes in the stomach are capable of denaturing proteins.  For proper protein function, the proteins must consist of specific shapes.  By denaturing potentially harmful proteins, they are rendered harmless in many cases.  They are also broken apart.  [Gastric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid) in the stomach is normally between 1.5 and 3.5 PH.  (Stomach acid can be incredibly acidic!)  So, if it reaches this point, the venom is most likely going to be broken down in the stomach.\n\nHowever, if the venom happens to make it to the digestive tract intact, then it could potentially leech into your system.  But, if it is possible for such a substance to reach this point, it is not actually a venom.  It is a poison!\n\nTo explain further, for an animal to be venomous, it must inject its venom by way of a sting or bite.  For an animal to be poisonous, however, it does not inject the toxins in the same manner.  Instead, you are harmed by swallowing the poison.  So, if a snake was commonly eaten and it resulted in people dying, the snake would be considered poisonous not venomous for this reason.  If this same snake could also harm people by biting them and injecting venom, the snake would then be poisonous and venomous!  Most snakes are simply venomous.  That is, consuming their venom is usually harmless.  It is not recommended that you do so, though, since it could potentially be toxic if it passes all of the digestive defenses, and no matter what you consume, if you consume enough of it, it will kill you.  The dose makes the poison.\n\n\"All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison.\" -- Paracelsus\n\nEdit: Clarification that saliva itself does not break down the proteins.  That starts in the stomach.\n\nNote: Bloodstream is a simplified term and circulatory system would probably be a better term to use.  Venom initially enters a different system designed to transport white blood cells and remove toxins from the body (lymphatic system).  For some venom, the molecules are too large to enter the bloodstream itself.  Comments from /u/KingKongBrandy and /u/Maj3sticCr0w led me to make this note.\n\n",

First, there is spit - chewing and mixing with spit is important for digestion because it helps make big chunks smaller, it helps smaller chunks slide down into the stomach, and the spit helps some things start to dissolve.  If you are chewing a venomous animal, there is a good chance that the chewing will burst the tissues where the venom is stored - that makes it less likely that the fangs or stingers can actually inject the venom.\n\nOnce the venomous parts get into the stomach, the acids within the stomach are often strong enough to \"de-nature\" many venom proteins.  \"De-nature\" basically means it changes shape to that it doesn't react the same way that it would have.  Then other enzymes begin to break everything down into even smaller chemical bits.  Those small chemical bits are mostly turned into new proteins that you need to rebuild your own cells, or energy that helps you move.\n\nSo eating venomous animals is not a super idea, because there are some risks of the venom getting through your skin (or digestive tract lining) but the venom itself is usually not dangerous to digest.\n\nOn the other hand, if you inject beef stew into your bloodstream, you could get very sick.\n\nEDIT:  I'm forced to amend my dangerous comments, as follows -\n1) Putting something in your mouth and then swallowing it is  ALMOST ALWAYS safer than poking it into your bloodstream.

Additionally, your vessels become 'leaky' and you get distribution of fluid from your intravascular spaces (i.e. in the arteries and veins) into your extravascular spaces which include interstitial tissue that make up your organs.\n\nSo when you come to hospital with a serious infection, the most important components of what we do are 1) intravenous fluid, typically 30ml/kg right off the bat intravenously and 2) antibiotics, in that order.

But how could it be deciphered if we didn't have that kind of cheat sheet? \n\nA fascinating example is [Linear B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_B), a pre-Ancient Greek language discovered on stone tablets on the island of Crete. It was long assumed that it would be completely indecipherable without some sort of \"Rosetta stone\", but we cracked the code in 1952, thanks to decades of study by [Alice Kober and Michael Ventris](http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22782620).\n\nThe first breakthrough came after Kober diligently recorded the frequency and position of each symbol on the tablets (While this type of analysis is not hard to do with computers today, this took *years* of work for Kober). In doing so, she discovered many instances of the same groups of symbols, but with consistently different endings. Through this, she realized that Linear B was an inflected language with different endings based on usage, like verb endings in Latin and Spanish. \n\nShe also noted that there were about 200 unique symbols in total. Being an expert of many languages, she knew that this was too many characters to be alphabetic (each symbol representing a letter - English, for example), and too few to be logographic (each symbol representing a word, like Chinese). She surmised that each symbol in Linear B likely represented a syllable. \n\nNow we have a clear understanding of what *type* of language Linear B was, but how do we determine what any of it means? This is where Ventris stepped up. \n\nHe theorized that these tablets likely had location names, and knew that location names often stayed similar over long periods of time. So he basically did ~~brute force~~ trial-and-error using the ancient Greek names for towns in Crete: What if a particular group of symbols are syllables that mean something like, \"ko-no-so\", meaning the Cretian city of Knossos? After exploring this idea in countless ways, he eventually discovered a pattern that confirmed this: When he interpreted one particular set of symbols as \"ko-no-so\", other symbols began to make sense. Slowly but surely, that first bit of translation led to him fully deciphering the entire language. \n\nEDIT: As /u/QuarkMawp pointed out, brute force was not the correct term.\n\nAnd since this has gotten some traction, if anybody is more interested in this and other sorts of amazing cryptography achievements throughout history, I highly recommend [The Code Book](https://simonsingh.net/books/the-code-book/) by Simon Singh. It covers a broad history of immense achievements in cryptography including Linear B, along with things like development of new codes in Renaissance Europe, cracking the Enigma Machine code in World War II, Navajo Wind Talkers and modern Public-Key Encryption. It's very informative and engaging, and also very accessible for the layperson. ",

Makes sense though, the natural world doesn't act in absolutes, but we as humans like to. I'll explain how we do it, but first let me ask you a question to think about: When does red become orange on the color spectrum? Surely it does as anyone would agree, but exactly where? Tough to say. Depends on who's looking, who you're asking, how you define red and orange. Lots of different things come in to play.\n\nAnyway. The most agreed upon way is that if 2 animals can reproduce and have a viable AND fertile offspring, then they are the same. Otherwise they are different.\n\nViable = able to live.\n\nFertile = able to reproduce.\n\nSo, for instance, if a human and a horse attempt to reproduce, they would have an inviable (and therefore infertile) offspring. So they are different species.\n\nIf a Donkey and a Horse reproduce they actually have a viable offspring. A mule. However, a mule is not fertile, so therefore cannot reproduce, so we call horses and donkeys different species.\n\nAnd finally, if 2 horses reproduce they have a viable and fertile offspring and are therefore considered the same species.\n\nThis is why ALL dogs are considered the same species according to a biologist, despite the remarkable differences between a chihuahua and a Great Dane.\n\n\nHOWEVER, there are exceptions to this. One example is in Giraffes. There are considered to be a handful of different species of giraffes in Africa (5 or 6, can't exactly remember). But the only difference between them are subtle differences in the patterns of spots in their hide. If and individual of one species got together with an individual of another and decided to reproduce they would produce a viable and fertile offspring. So why don't we say there is one one species of giraffe in Africa, similar to dogs? Because, as far as we can tell, these different species NEVER reproduce with each other naturally. They all mind there own business, have their own territories and are all separate from each other, so we go ahead and say they are different species.\n\nSimilar exceptions can be found all over the world. And of course it gets much more complicated when we start trying to differentiate between single-cell organisms/bacteria/viruses especially are very odd and full of exceptions to our rules.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps!\n\nSpeciation is the term you should do research on if you want more info. It's actually a very interesting area of evolution and is often overlooked!",

Your body can create eggs in which the telomeres are restored, allowing for a new human baby that can then continue to grow up normally. Thus, clearly a mechanism exists to correct the loss of telomeres (i.e. [telomerase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomerase)).  Further, research with rats has shown that disabling telomerase has little to no effect on the health or aging processes of rats for up to 6 generations.\n\nThe answer to your question is currently not well understood but appears to be related to the scientific field known as \"[epigenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics)\".  Epigenetics is the study of how gene expression changes over your lifetime and how these changes in expression can be handed down over generations.\n\nAsk yourself this, why is it that every cell in your body has the same DNA and yet some cells grow up to be skin, others to be brain or muscle or liver?  Epigenetics! i.e. the selective expression of some genes over others.\n\nThe reason an egg can become a new human that doesn't possess the age of its parent is because the epigenetic markers of the parent are \"reset\" when the egg is produced.  This suggests that age is a process by which epigenetic changes accumulate over the life span of an organism.  These changes may be somewhat programmed to happen, but are also influenced by environment (e.g. toxins from smoking that reduce life span).  [In fact, your age can be \"guessed\" to within about +/- 5 years just by counting the number of epigenetic markers in your DNA.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0014821)\n\nSo, to answer your question, the most likely cause of aging is that we are in fact programmed to do so.

I thought that whole 200GiB gimmick was silly and ingenious at the same time.\n\nSD cards are more arbitrary, so it would probably be better to work in centimeters, I mean you wouldn't mind a 1 cm by 1 cm (square) by 10 mm thick card if it hit the theoretical limit, would you? It would also be easy to relate to the size of an SD card.\n\nEven better is they use something called nanometer or nm gauged setups, which you get a million per centimeter. So 1,000,000 * 1,000,000 is 1,000,000,000,000 or a trillion bits. Since we use bytes instead of bits you divide by 8 and round to the nearest computing magnitude yielding 128 GiB. Why not 125? Because in computing the numbers work on doubling rather than incrementing like in decimal. This is called binary, or hexadecimal (meaning 6 and 10, or 16). Anyways, you're probably going to be looking at something like 2^40 or 1,099,511,627,776 bits rather than an even trillion.\n\nSo wait, we have cards that have 256 GiB that are much smaller than a centimeter and we're not even to a 1 nm process yet? What evil magic is this?! It isn't. It's called layers. I'm sure you don't want a card only a nanometer thick!

[Notice here it says Samsung's microSD cards are made out of what? **3D** V-NAND](http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-launches-a-256gb-microsd-card). They are saying they can make this up to 100 layers thick, and they are using a [19 nanometer process (PDF file)](http://www.samsung.com/us/business/discover/solid-state-drives/assets/pdf/3bit_V-NAND_White_Paper.pdf) to do it. Yes, that's 20x less capacity than we've been working with here, but it doesn't matter when you have 100x more room.\n\nIf they ever do get that down to 1 nm you'll have 100 trillion little switches! Not only that but what if that allows them to increase the amount of layers by 20x as well? Then you're looking at quadrillions, or 15 zeroes. Those would be petabytes or PB.

The bullet hits 2cm low. So you lower the crosshair by a *very* slight amount using a measurement system built into the scope adjustments, which then when you put the crosshair back on the same location, means the barrel of the rifle is now pointed ever so slightly more upward, meaning the impact of the bullet is also higher. The name of the game is to try and get the crosshair and impact to be at the same location.\n\nBut then it will only be on at that exact point in two locations. Generally a rifle zeroed (crosshair and impact overlap) at 100m, which also means it will be zeroed again at 300-400m, depending on the ballistics of the bullet. This is because the barrel and the scope have parallax; a difference in their viewing planes set apart by a small angle. The convergence of these planes only happens once if you were to draw a straight line coming from both of these objects, and that would be where you zeroed the rifle previously. Now, because of physics and the loss of energy and speed in the bullet over time and distance, its trajectory also changed. This brings the path of the bullet back down in an arc to travel over the crosshair a second time, given enough distance. \n\nIf you were to shoot at a target closer than your first zero distance, the bullet would impact lower than your crosshair, but no lower than the distance between the centerline of the scope and the centerline of the barrel. Shooting at a target between the first and second zero distances mean the bullet will impact high, and finally shooting past your second zero distance will mean the bullet will impact low. There's lots of very complicated physics and ballistic science to tell you what exactly those offsets will be for a given round fired from a given rifle in different conditions, so I can't tell you what those numbers would be.\n\nYou could, however, run those numbers yourself and find out where in the bullet's trajectory, if you held the gun at 1 degree inclination, peaks, then set your zero to that distance. The bullet would continue to rise from the barrel's height to be right on target at that distance, and then drop from it at further distances. This means that up to most likely 400-500m you won't have any real noticeable vertical deviation, as the maximum distance between a barrel and a scope is usually only 3-4cm. You'll know that at, say 200m, you'll need to hold only 2cm high to get a very accurate shot.",

Your relative social status and seniority to those around you is something that you and others are expected to be aware of and acting properly in accordance with at almost all times.\n\nThe words you're referring to are known as *honorifics*. We use some in English, though usually only a few - \"sir,\" \"ma'am,\" \"Mister,\" \"Missus,\" etc. But even here there aren't nearly as many and are often just used for general respect.\n\nIt's also worth noting that in Japan, these honorifics are added at the end of the name, rather than at the start.\n\nIn Japan, unless you're talking to a very close friend or family member (and sometimes even not then), you're expected to use some kind of honorific to denote your relative social status to whoever you're talking to.\n\nSenpai (sometimes se**m**pai) for example, denotes speaking to an upperclassman, or someone senior, but on the same general level as you. Whether that's someone at a higher grade level, or someone in your work that has been there longer (but is in the same position), it denotes \"someone with more experience in this particular aspect of life.\" This can also be used just as a word or titles on its own, not always needing coupled with a name.\n\n\"-kun\" is generally used to denote someone that is your relative equal, and usually reserved for males. So a friend or classmate that's at the same level of experience or grade that you're at. If a friend or classmate at the same level might pass you in the hall, they'd say \"What's up, ABallof115-kun?\"\n\nSome other fairly common ones:\n\n\"-san\" is the general equivalent of Mr./Mrs or Sir/Ma'am, used to denote respect towards someone of a higher standing than yourself, or to be more than normal levels of polite to.\n\n\"-sama\" is used for a *very* high level of respect towards someone much higher than yourself socially, a sort of equivalent to \"my lord\" or a similar title. We don't have a direct equivalent because it kind of begins and ends with Mr./Mrs. In some media, it's also used as a title given to the subject of a crush or object of affection, usually to show how much higher they think of that person.\n\n\"-dono\" is exceedingly formal, and really isn't used much in modern times (though not completely gone). Similar to \"sama,\" it implies a very high level of formality and respect to the one you're speaking to. In more modern times, this might be something you'd use for the head of a corporation or a high ranking public official in a very formal setting.\n\n\"-chan\" is speaking to someone of lower social standing than yourself, usually with the connotation of someone much younger, and has a slightly informal edge to it. This is something you might call a younger cousin or a friend's child.",

If nothing else, it's been quite some time since most cultures buried their dead with anything of value. \"Grave robbing,\" as such, hasn't really been a profitable activity for several centuries now. But most governments nonetheless have rules about not disturbing formally recognized grave sites (e.g., cemeteries) for *any* reason, including things like construction. The concern is pretty much the same: protecting the dignity of spaces in which people bury their dead. This is one of *the* oldest traditions in human culture. \n\nAs to how much time goes by before disturbing graves becomes okay? There's no specific rule. It's more a question of whether a particular burial site is *protected* as a \"grave\" site by whatever government has jurisdiction over the site. Just because a site is some person's final resting place does not mean that the site will be formally recognized as a \"grave\". \n\nSo, for instance, any time a contractor is doing excavation work in a major urban area (say for a new high rise), it's not uncommon for them to turn up human remains, even in places with no previously recorded burial activity. When that happens, the usual result is to stop work on the project until the city sends out an archaeologist and/or forensics expert to examine the site. Maybe it's a crime scene. Maybe it's an indigenous people's burial ground. Maybe it's an important archaeological/palentological find. Who knows? But it probably *won't* be formally recognized as a \"grave\" no matter the outcome. The remains will usually be offered some dignified reburial elsewhere, but removed they will be. \n\nOn the other hand, I used to live in a city with an interstate beltway. The interchange nearest my office has just about *the* most ass-backwards layout you could imagine. To the point that I'd use two separate exits in my morning and evening commutes, because the one closest to my house didn't actually lead to the office coming from that direction. Why? Because there's a mid-nineteenth-century cemetery located *right* in the middle of the north-side of the interchange, *exactly* where the south-bound off-ramp would normally cross the intersecting road. It was apparently deemed to be impossible to get permission from the relevant descendants (or just too expensive to track them all down). Hence the idiotic ramp layout.

That means engineers used electronic or mechanical means to capture and transfer sound. These are called analog technology. \n\n\nFor example, a tape player is *analog*. It plays back sound through mechanical means.\n\n\nMeanwhile, your computer plays *digital* sound. This is encoded data that the computer reads and translates into sound.\n\n\nWell, almost all the consumer wired headphones are *analog* technology. However, our phones and the music we play is obviously *digital*.\n\n\nThat means phones need DACs installed in the phone. These are digital to analog converters. Compared to other cell phone parts, they are typically much larger and I presume there's a physical limitation to how small they can make them. Also DACs can have a significant effect on sound quality. It's like having someone interpret spanish to you that isn't very good vs a native speaker. Some things may get lost in translation sound wise with a bad DAC. \n\n\nWell the way to get significant space to make the phone smaller, and possibly conserve battery life would be to eliminate the DAC and headphone jack altogether. \n\n\nIn addition, more phones are competing for Water resistant certifications. And the headphone jack presents a challenge because it needs to be able to conduct electricity yet, resist water damage. \n\n\nLastly, less analog parts and less ports means less maintenance issues. One more port and the DAC means one more chance for something to put the phone out of commission. \n\n\nThe downside though, is that digital headphones aren't prevelant and not nearly as cheap. Obviously, having sound go through same port as charging is not ideal. There isn't a standard that all manufacturers can agree on for digital headphones. This leaves Apple to charge a premium price for proprietary technology.\n\n\nApple has a rich tradition of not clinging to tradition. If they see something that represents holding back future change, they don't mind dropping it. They also aren't nearly as afraid to require customers to buy proprietary technology because they have a business model that supports this dynamic with their customer. Plus their market segment does not include customers looking for the best bargain. That gives Apple alot of flexibility.",

        "body": "So many very incorrect responses here. I was kind of afraid of opening this thread for this reason, but here goes...\n\nFallout is a concern when you detonate nuclear weapons on the surface. Even small nuclear weapons can produce considerable contamination downwind. The Trinity shot of 1945, for example, [created quite a large plume](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Trinity-fallout.jpg). You wouldn't want to be someone who lived in that plume; close-in to the site, it could actually kill you or give you radiation sickness. Further out, it raises cancer rates.\n\n[The huge contaminating plumes from multi-megaton bombs](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Castle-Bravo-fallout.jpg) did contaminate the test sites they were set off in, and people did have to be evacuated, and many people who lived near the test sites did contract cancers, have higher rates of birth defects, etc. \n\nIn the United States, people living due-east of the Nevada Test Site (e.g. in Utah) [did pick up significant levels of radiation from the drifting clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site#/media/File:US_fallout_exposure.png). Individually this adds up to a small dose; over a large population this means an increase in cancers.

This probably _under_estimates the effects a bit but I just want to emphasize that the answer to your question is not \"they made it work perfectly safe and it wasn't a problem,\" the answer is, \"they exposed huge populations of people to radioactivity, and justified it by arguing that the safety of the nation was worth their collective sacrifice.\"\n\nAfter 1962 the US, USSR, and UK did all of their testing underground.

By comparison [here is one from the 1960s](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Fallout_Map_3-23-1963-Saturday-Evening-Post.jpg), which has more realistic weather patterns.\n\n\"Safe\" is always relative here. If you know how to take shelter from fallout and have shelter facilities available to you, in many cases you can be reasonably safe from it. The destruction of cities and infrastructure will have other impacts, of course, that will make life post-attack \"less safe\" (e.g., disrupting your food and energy supply).",

Even small nuclear weapons can produce considerable contamination downwind. The Trinity shot of 1945, for example, <a href=\"http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Trinity-fallout.jpg\">created quite a large plume</a>. You wouldn&#39;t want to be someone who lived in that plume; close-in to the site, it could actually kill you or give you radiation sickness. Further out, it raises cancer rates.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Castle-Bravo-fallout.jpg\">The huge contaminating plumes from multi-megaton bombs</a> did contaminate the test sites they were set off in, and people did have to be evacuated, and many people who lived near the test sites did contract cancers, have higher rates of birth defects, etc. </p>\n\n<p>In the United States, people living due-east of the Nevada Test Site (e.g. in Utah) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada_Test_Site#/media/File:US_fallout_exposure.png\">did pick up significant levels of radiation from the drifting clouds</a>.

        "body": "In the old days, when you created a user account you would ask the user to choose a username and a password. You'd simply store those two things, and whenever the user wanted to log in you'd just look up the username in your database, compare the password they entered to the one set for that username, and let that user log in if the password matched.\n\nThere were two problems with this. The first one is that anyone who had access to your database could simply look up user passwords, and log in as those users. You'd have no way of knowing. The other problem is, someone could gain unauthorized access to your system and obtain the entire database of usernames and passwords, and then they'd know exactly what to type in to login as anyone.\n\nOkay, so that's no good. What to do? Someone had an idea\u2014when a user creates an account, let's not store the password. Instead, let's encrypt the password using a particular technique called a *one-way hashing function*. Sounds complicated, but it's really not. All it means is that you jumble up the password the user entered in such a way that you can't undo it to get back to the original password.\n\nFor example, let's think about numbers for a minute. If you give me a method of \"encryption\" where, say, you take my number and multiply by 3 and add 5, if I choose a number like 15, then you store 50 (3\\*15 + 5). The problem with this method is that if someone gets the database and sees 50 next to my name, they'd type that in and it would fail. But, since they have access to my system, they can go through it and see what method I use. Once they know that, they can simply subtract 5 then divide by 3 to undo the operation, then log in with 15. This is *not* a one-way hashing function.\n\nInstead, what you could do if you're clever, though, is encourage me to choose some big number, and then divide it by something, and take the remainder. Look how this works: if I choose, say 13,456,994 as my number, and you divide by 145, you get 92,806 remainder 124. You store only the 124, though. Next time I log in, as long as the number I put in gives a remainder of 124 when divided by 145, you let me in. The bad guy doesn't know what I'm putting in, though. Ah, but they could figure out that all they have to do is put in some number that gives the same remainder when divided by 145\u2014good point. So you also keep the average of the digits in addition to the remainder rounded down to the nearest whole number. Now the database stores a remainder of 124 and 5 as the average of the digits. Well this makes the problem a little harder for you to find a number that has a remainder of 124 as well as 5 as an average of the digits, but you could probably do it. But you see the point by now, right?\n\nSo, a one-way hashing function is a function that produces an answer which can only be reversed into a particular input with a LOT of work. It's actually less work to just try to guess passwords, put them through the one-way hashing function, and see if they match. You could easily create an entire dictionary of common passwords based on the one-way hashing function I use, then just compare those to all of the encrypted values I've stored\u2014you'll probably get a lot of matches, and each one is an account you can log in to.\n\nThis is why sites force people to use special characters. The hope is that you'll be forced to take some kind of password you would have normally chosen that's in the bad guy's encrypted dictionary and modify it in such a way that it isn't in there.\n\n(Unfortunately, this is no longer a good approach. All of the modifications people typically make are now in the bad guy dictionary. For instance, if you would have used `password` as your password, but there's rules, you might instead choose `pa$$w0rd`. The bad guys know this, though, so they simply add more entries to their dictionary to include all these variants as well, the encrypted versions of: `passw0rd`, `pa$sword`, `pa$$word`, and so on.)

        "body": "Information security has a concept called \"security in layers\".  What this means is that rather than use one security method to protect data, you use many methods.\n\nFor passwords, you require the password to be reasonably complex as the first layer.  Rules for this vary, but it is usually at least 8 characters with a mix of upper and lower case, numbers and a special character.  Additional rules are it can't be your username, it can't be a dictionary word and it can't be the common choices like \"password\". Okay, so there is layer one.\n\nThen you allow 3 attempts for the user to put in the correct password before you lock the account.  This allows for the inevitable fat-fingering people do when inputting their password.  Now most large corporations don't have the time or resources to have a real person reset your password when you lock your account or forget your password so they have a password reset function which usually consists of sending a temporary password to an email address you designated. You then use this temporary password to log in to the system which then requires you to immediately reset your password again (because the temporary password was sent to you in an email and is therefor not secure).  So there is layer two.\n\nMost corporations also require their employees to change their password every 90 days.  This is so if the account has been compromised, it limits the amount of time it is open to use by unauthorized people.  This is layer three.\n\nThen, as others have said, you one-way hash the password in order to store it so it can't be stolen from the database.  This requires a program called a hashing algorithm.  This is layer four.\n\nThere can be a lot more layers and ways to protect accounts but they all have flaws.  Complex passwords are hard to remember so people may right them down.  Your email account where you receive your temporary password can be compromised so someone could reset your password for you.  Changing your password every 90 days means you are more likely to forget your new password and then have to reset it again. Using a password hashing algorithm is great as long as no one gets access to it and there are info sec rules about not storing your hashing program on the same server as you store your hashed passwords.  The point is, everything has a cost.  The key is to figure out what protections are the most effective individually and together and then build your layers to provide the most protection at the lowest cost.\n\nFor you as an individual, some good rules are to not use the same password on different systems.  I use complex, unique passwords on any system that has my critical info, like banking and email.  On systems that don't have my critical info, I might share a password between them, but still have it be complex.  I also use mnemonics to create my passwords so they are easy for me to remember, but hard for someone to guess or brute force.\n\nThe absolutely easiest way to protect your password is to use a password product that you have one password to use and then the product creates very complex passwords for all the systems you have to log into.  Corporations don't use these products because it can be a big expense for them to buy and maintain.",

Rules for this vary, but it is usually at least 8 characters with a mix of upper and lower case, numbers and a special character.  Additional rules are it can&#39;t be your username, it can&#39;t be a dictionary word and it can&#39;t be the common choices like &quot;password&quot;. Okay, so there is layer one.</p>\n\n<p>Then you allow 3 attempts for the user to put in the correct password before you lock the account.  This allows for the inevitable fat-fingering people do when inputting their password.  Now most large corporations don&#39;t have the time or resources to have a real person reset your password when you lock your account or forget your password so they have a password reset function which usually consists of sending a temporary password to an email address you designated. You then use this temporary password to log in to the system which then requires you to immediately reset your password again (because the temporary password was sent to you in an email and is therefor not secure).  So there is layer two.</p>\n\n<p>Most corporations also require their employees to change their password every 90 days.  This is so if the account has been compromised, it limits the amount of time it is open to use by unauthorized people.  This is layer three.</p>\n\n<p>Then, as others have said, you one-way hash the password in order to store it so it can&#39;t be stolen from the database.  This requires a program called a hashing algorithm.  This is layer four.</p>\n\n<p>There can be a lot more layers and ways to protect accounts but they all have flaws.  Complex passwords are hard to remember so people may right them down.  Your email account where you receive your temporary password can be compromised so someone could reset your password for you.  Changing your password every 90 days means you are more likely to forget your new password and then have to reset it again. Using a password hashing algorithm is great as long as no one gets access to it and there are info sec rules about not storing your hashing program on the same server as you store your hashed passwords.  The point is, everything has a cost.  The key is to figure out what protections are the most effective individually and together and then build your layers to provide the most protection at the lowest cost.</p>\n\n<p>For you as an individual, some good rules are to not use the same password on different systems.  I use complex, unique passwords on any system that has my critical info, like banking and email.  On systems that don&#39;t have my critical info, I might share a password between them, but still have it be complex.  I also use mnemonics to create my passwords so they are easy for me to remember, but hard for someone to guess or brute force.</p>\n\n<p>The absolutely easiest way to protect your password is to use a password product that you have one password to use and then the product creates very complex passwords for all the systems you have to log into.  Corporations don&#39;t use these products because it can be a big expense for them to buy and maintain.</p>\n</div>",

The amount (volume) of ejaculate will be a little more if it's been awhile since you ejaculated and less if you ejaculated recently.\n\nA man's body is constantly producing sperm and storing it up for ejaculation.  This gets mixed with fluid produced by the seminal vesicles and prostate.  Apart from frequency of ejaculation, the amount of time spent in sexual activity and the amount of arousal can also affect the volume of ejaculate.  The longer the build-up, arousal, and direct stimulation prior to ejaculation, the more volume of fluid can be produced to mix with sperm for ejaculation.  Some men also have noticed that this increase in ejaculate volume with longer stimulation also produces a waterier semen because of the increased fluid to sperm ratio.\n\nSo it stands to reason that if you are dehydrated, your volume will probably be less.  Other factors that affect it are getting proper amounts of zinc in your diet, getting good sleep, stress levels and your frequency of ejaculation.  Genetic factors and age also play a part, but those are not under your control.  Strengthening your PC muscles can produce stronger contractions on orgasm and help push out more fluid.",

Some men also have noticed that this increase in ejaculate volume with longer stimulation also produces a waterier semen because of the increased fluid to sperm ratio.</p>\n\n<p>So it stands to reason that if you are dehydrated, your volume will probably be less.  Other factors that affect it are getting proper amounts of zinc in your diet, getting good sleep, stress levels and your frequency of ejaculation.  Genetic factors and age also play a part, but those are not under your control.  Strengthening your PC muscles can produce stronger contractions on orgasm and help push out more fluid.</p>\n</div>",

A byte is a rank of eight binary values.\n\nIn computing, the SI prefixes kilo, mega, tera, peta, exa, were adopted in a context specific fashion. In some contexts, they refer to 2^10, 2^20, 2^30, 2^40, 2^50 respectively; in the remaining contexts they refer to 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, 10^12, and 10^15 respectively.\n\nComputer networking has its roots in digital telephony which used 8000 digital samples per second per channel to transmit digital voice data. 8000 samples is sufficient to capture the lower 4Khz of the audible spectrum, which encapsulates most of the human voice. 8000 samples at a sample size of 8 bits per sample (one byte), yielded 64,000 bits per second. This remains the standard for a digital \"voice channel\" today and is usually presented as 64kilobits per second.

Hard disks and solid state storage devices are *block devices*, meaning that they are not indexed by bit or by byte, but rather by a larger construct known as a block. Blocks are generally either 512 bytes in size, or 4096 bytes in size depending on the device. The number of blocks on a device is either a power of two, or some integer multiple of a power of two. For reasons that I won't go into, integrated design really likes powers of two, followed by multiples of powers of two. Either way, all storage devices are base-2 at their core.

        "body": "This is a conjectural question and I have a conjectural answer based on my background in Biochemistry, my current training as a PhD student in Metabolic Engineering, and my personal interest in exercise science.\n\nWe know that weight can fluctuate by a few percent on a daily basis, but that consistent weight loss on a calorie-restricted diet takes at least one week to see. In fact, many people (myself included) who aim to lose weight generally don't see much of a change for the first 2-6 weeks. This is not because they aren't losing fat, but because they are retaining some water as their fat cells begin to shrink. Fat is stored in adipocytes in big globules which shrink when fat is mobilized. Cells \"don't know\" when they will have to fill those globules up again, so they pack water in in the interim to keep the space. Many human metabolic regulatory mechanisms are thought to have evolved through feast-famine cycles, and this is one of them. \n\nAll that to say that you probably start burning up fat in less than the time it takes you to see measurable weight loss. That puts our time scale at a week or less. Now, as you mentioned, there are a lot of different energy sources we can draw on during exercise. Quick energy is generally preferred, though this depends on the duration and intensity of the exercise. If you're on a calorie-restricted diet, though, your body would prefer to use fat a little bit more than usual. So it wouldn't be impossible to begin burning up fat molecules right away during exercise! However, you don't actually burn many calories from a single cardio session. I have to run for about an hour to burn 500 calories, personally. Only a percentage of that comes from fat, and fat is calorie-dense, so it wouldn't translate to a lot of mass lost. If I ran for an hour and used 60% of the calories I burned from fat, I'd have lost just 33 g. Not a lot! This is the reason why cardio is an awful way to lose weight on its own, by the way. \n\nSo the lower limit to our time scale is minutes. But, at that time scale, we don't expect significant changes to measured weight.\n\nKnowing what I know about the dynamics of metabolic regulation (the subject of my thesis, actually), my guess is that when you restrict calories you start losing small amounts of fat immediately, but that the proportion of calories used from fat takes a few days, or even a week, to reach a maximum value. Even at that maximal rate of fat use, it might be hard to measure changes on any time scale shorter than a day because of the energy density of fat. So, if you're well into a sustainable calorie-restricted diet, controlling salt intake and exercise very carefully, you might be able to measure the weight of fat you've lost in a day. *Might* is the operative word here.\n\nThere are physiological signs of fat use, and metabolic studies use these to measure fat loss on short time scales. It's not ELI5 material, but you might consider looking at studies in which participants live in controlled environments in which everything about their metabolism - even their CO2 outputs - is carefully measured. These may be able to give you a more precise answer.  ",

Not so much so for your base models but for higher end cars Top Speed and how quickly a car gets there may affect which car someone buys.\n* The second is engine size. the larger an engine in terms of capacity and the number of cylinders makes a car smoother, hence why a Bentley may have a 12 cylinder engine, but may only produce as much power as a 6 cylinder, more sporty car. A by-product of this may be that the top speed is higher, and will certainly be higher than the top speed of any speed limit.\n* A sub point of the one above is engine wear. Larger engines tend to take the stress of mileage a lot better. This would obviously depend who and how they drive it, but an engine working at less stress is generally a less troublesome one. A by product of this is a higher top speed (in some cases)\n* The next is top speeds of roads. In Germany they have speed limitless motorways/freeways called Autobahns. This means in certain markets it is appealing to have a car that can far exceed a speed limit that may appear in another country and it would not be cost-efficient for a manufacturer to tailor a car just for one market (we're talking speed here, not other factors such as which hand drive the car is)\n* If a state/country was to make law that cars had to have a speed limiter, it would only apply to new cars and would cause a gigantic list of issues and cost for very little gain. It would also mean that governments could not earn revenue from fining motorists for breaking the limits (like it or not, it is a fact the government earns money from people using their car above the road limits).\n* The most important thing about the top speed is related to a cars gear ratios and where a car will sit in terms of speed and revolutions (RPM) of the engine. A combustion engine car (a car that takes petrol or diesel) will be most efficient sitting in RPM and speed terms towards the lower to middle end of its RPM scale (if a car red lines at 8,000 rpm, 2,500-4,000 rpm will likely be its most efficient). This satisfies two things, one is fuel consumption, which affects why someone may buy a car, less fuel consumption means less money spent on fuel, and the next is emissions standards, which is particularly important in countries such as Britain, where the amount of tax on a vehicle is based on the amount of emissions the car kicks out. To satisfy this, the very top of the highest most gear would need to be well above the local speed limits in order for that speed limit to achieve good fuel consumption and limit emissions. \n    \nThe points above generally fit under a limiter fitted to a car to limit its top speed. It would be far too expensive to carry out an operation like this, and my cynical view is governments would not earn revenue from people breaking the speed limit and instead would have to spend money enforcing limiters. Manufacturers don't limit speeds because they are competing against each other, who in turn are all trying to get the most in every way out of a car.\n     \nThe next points relate to having engines small enough so that they can only reach 70. This would be incredibly impractical for everyday use as I will explain:    \n* Hills. Going up a hill is harder work for an engine. A small engine would struggle with a hill.     \n* People and weight. Cars and vehicles are used to transport things, limiting an engine size limits a cars ability to transport more things. A phenomenon which every young man with a car will experience is their first car. Traditionally a young British male's first car will be a small, cheap and old hatchback with a tiny little engine as this is the only form of motoring he can afford. Carrying on tradition, you will at some point ferry yourself and 4 of your near-adult weight friends around to your destination (a lot of the time there is no destination and you are just simply driving your mates around). These small engines struggle greatly and performance is hindered, and if you add a hill, the problem gets twice as bad.\n\n     I will now list these quickly:\n* Acceleration/Performance of a small engine would be terrible, trying to keep up with traffic would be a constant task/worry\n* Fuel consumption would be terrible\n* Engine wear would happen a lot quicker as parts are having to work harder.\n     \nThe list is endless, but another side point is, for everyone that enjoys their cars - if someone made you limit your car to a speed, would you enjoy it as much? The answer is probably not, and the economy surrounding cars is too great for one government to lose over another (think of tourism Germany gets for individuals wanting to take their cars to the Nurburgring and on their Autobahns.)\n     \nNote - I feel this was very long winded. Feel free to pick at anything. Honestly.    \n\nEdit - Thank you for your comments. As Kkrit pointed out - most of Germany's Autobahn's have top speed limits now, but there are still a few without. It is without doubt the most famous and unique example of where speed limits aren't in place.\n    \nEdit 2 - I tidied the formatting up!",

A by product of this is a higher top speed (in some cases)</li>\n<li>The next is top speeds of roads. In Germany they have speed limitless motorways/freeways called Autobahns. This means in certain markets it is appealing to have a car that can far exceed a speed limit that may appear in another country and it would not be cost-efficient for a manufacturer to tailor a car just for one market (we&#39;re talking speed here, not other factors such as which hand drive the car is)</li>\n<li>If a state/country was to make law that cars had to have a speed limiter, it would only apply to new cars and would cause a gigantic list of issues and cost for very little gain. It would also mean that governments could not earn revenue from fining motorists for breaking the limits (like it or not, it is a fact the government earns money from people using their car above the road limits).</li>\n<li>The most important thing about the top speed is related to a cars gear ratios and where a car will sit in terms of speed and revolutions (RPM) of the engine. A combustion engine car (a car that takes petrol or diesel) will be most efficient sitting in RPM and speed terms towards the lower to middle end of its RPM scale (if a car red lines at 8,000 rpm, 2,500-4,000 rpm will likely be its most efficient). This satisfies two things, one is fuel consumption, which affects why someone may buy a car, less fuel consumption means less money spent on fuel, and the next is emissions standards, which is particularly important in countries such as Britain, where the amount of tax on a vehicle is based on the amount of emissions the car kicks out. To satisfy this, the very top of the highest most gear would need to be well above the local speed limits in order for that speed limit to achieve good fuel consumption and limit emissions. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The points above generally fit under a limiter fitted to a car to limit its top speed. It would be far too expensive to carry out an operation like this, and my cynical view is governments would not earn revenue from people breaking the speed limit and instead would have to spend money enforcing limiters. Manufacturers don&#39;t limit speeds because they are competing against each other, who in turn are all trying to get the most in every way out of a car.</p>\n\n<p>The next points relate to having engines small enough so that they can only reach 70. This would be incredibly impractical for everyday use as I will explain:<br/>\n* Hills. Going up a hill is harder work for an engine. A small engine would struggle with a hill.<br/>\n* People and weight. Cars and vehicles are used to transport things, limiting an engine size limits a cars ability to transport more things. A phenomenon which every young man with a car will experience is their first car. Traditionally a young British male&#39;s first car will be a small, cheap and old hatchback with a tiny little engine as this is the only form of motoring he can afford. Carrying on tradition, you will at some point ferry yourself and 4 of your near-adult weight friends around to your destination (a lot of the time there is no destination and you are just simply driving your mates around). These small engines struggle greatly and performance is hindered, and if you add a hill, the problem gets twice as bad.</p>\n\n<pre><code> I will now list these quickly:\n</code></pre>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Acceleration/Performance of a small engine would be terrible, trying to keep up with traffic would be a constant task/worry</li>\n<li>Fuel consumption would be terrible</li>\n<li>Engine wear would happen a lot quicker as parts are having to work harder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The list is endless, but another side point is, for everyone that enjoys their cars - if someone made you limit your car to a speed, would you enjoy it as much? The answer is probably not, and the economy surrounding cars is too great for one government to lose over another (think of tourism Germany gets for individuals wanting to take their cars to the Nurburgring and on their Autobahns.)</p>\n\n<p>Note - I feel this was very long winded. Feel free to pick at anything. Honestly.    </p>\n\n<p>Edit - Thank you for your comments. As Kkrit pointed out - most of Germany&#39;s Autobahn&#39;s have top speed limits now, but there are still a few without. It is without doubt the most famous and unique example of where speed limits aren&#39;t in place.</p>\n\n<p>Edit 2 - I tidied the formatting up!</p>\n</div>",

It's only fitting that I use the Martini Cocktail for the explanation as many will be familiar with the famous line from James Bond, \"shaken, not stirred.\"\n\n**Stirred Process**\n\nAll the wet ingredients (in this case, vermouth and spirit) will be added to a mixing glass before filling it with as much ice as possible. The ingredients are added before the ice to avoid uncontrolled dilution that would occur if it were to be done the other way round. \n\nPreferably the ice will be large blocks or cubes as smaller blocks of ice will melt much quicker during the stirring process causing the drink to be over diluted before its reached the desired temperature. The bartender will test the drink for correct temperature and dilution during the stirring process before double/fine straining the drink in to a chilled cocktail glass and adding any garnish. \n\n**Stirred Results**\n\nStirring results in a transparent and more viscous Martini as it hasn't been aerated at all. This means it'll feel thicker and almost silky on the tongue. \n\nEven though the process takes longer than shaking I would personally choose a stirred Martini as there is more chance of the Bartender making it well. This is due to them having more opportunity to test the drink and control dilution. \n\n\n**Shaken Process**\n\nAll the wet ingredients are added to a cocktail shaker or Boston glass before adding as much ice as possible (again, to avoid uncontrolled dilution). The same requirements regarding good, large, ice pieces apply. \n\nThe lid is put on the shaker (or tin to top the Boston glass) and it'll be shaken vigorously until a frost starts to form on the shaker/tin. The drink will then be tested by the bartender before double/fine straining the drink in to a chilled cocktail glass and garnishing. \n\nNote that with a shaken Martini, there is not much that can be done to fix the drink after testing if it doesn't taste right. Especially if it's down to over dilution. \n\n**Shaken Results**\n\nA shaken Martini will be opaque rather than totally transparent due to the shaking process causing aeration. These small bubbles cause the drink to feel less smooth on the tongue. Eventually they will rise to the top and disappear but not before the drink has risen in temperature. \n\nShaking a Martini also causes small fragments of ice to break off in to the drink which amplifies the importance of fine straining it before serving. Many bartenders overlook this so it is something else to take in to consideration regarding the texture/feel of a shaken Martini. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStirring is the longer of the two processes which gives the bartender more control over dilution and temperature. When this is done correctly it will result in a smooth, silky drink. \n\nShaking is a faster process with less control over dilution and temperature. Shaking aerates the drink resulting in a less silky texture. \n\nIf both techniques are used correctly there should be very little difference in the flavour profile. \n\n*source: bar support, head bartender, restaurant owner, consultant over 15 years.*",

If you don't want to fight you turn your back and that's it. There are players that fight and players that don't, and it's not really a machismo/honor thing that you MUST fight. No one thinks less of you for not being a fighter.\nIf you jump someone who is NOT looking for a fight you are usually going to get tossed from the game and probably suspended for a few games to boot. It's not OK to blind-side someone who is not likewise spoiling for a fight and generally speaking that is frowned upon.\nSo the minor penalties and general lack of punishment is only in the case of two people who have collaboratively decided to go at it, which is true for almost every fight you see. They are pre-arranged (often at the face-off) and mutually agreed. At that point, two consenting adults doing what they want, basically, and the refs leave it alone until someone is at risk of getting seriously hurt -- usually once someone goes down and it's no longer a standing fight, or if other people are getting involved, or if one person is effectively incapacitated, etc.\nTo some degree hockey is a self-regulated game. Refs are there for line calls, not necessarily behavior control. 10 people flying around a small ice surface at 40km/h with wooden sticks can REALLY hurt each other while the ref is looking the other way if they want to.\nTo avoid this, fighting is used as a pressure relief... all the pent up aggression you feel for the wrongs and slights done to your team goes into cheering for your guy in the fight. Afterward everyone chills out. This is generally true even if the two guys fighting aren't the actual guys you were mad at. But the thing is, everyone on your team is going to be mad at someone different for some random thing that happened, so it's not practical to expect everyone will \"pay\" individually.\nThis mostly works because most players aren't assholes. If they do something to earn your ire it was probably by accident or a \"one time\" thing. It's unlikely you'll remember it for more than 5 minutes and unlikely that guy is going to specifically tick you off again. So the fight serves to release the cumulative pressure of all those little things, not necessarily any specific incident.\nWhere this fails is if there is just that one total dick on a team that is constantly cheap-shotting people or otherwise behaving in a douchey way not consistent with the overall tone of the game. Especially if that person keeps doing it even after a fight or two. At some point the other team is going to remember his number and a \"generic fight\" won't fix the issue. That guy now has a target painted on his back and at some point -- maybe not even that game but in a future game -- someone is going to risk getting tossed from the game/suspended to teach that specific player a lesson.\nThough usually half of that guy's own team are just as happy to watch him get creamed because, honestly, he IS a dick. We'd never say it out loud of course, team solidarity, rah rah rah... but at some point people get what they deserve and everyone on both sides knows it.\nEDIT: Others replies here have also made the very good point that I feel worth highlighting... a hockey fight is not like MMA. It's really hard to get leverage on ice and there's only so much weight you can get behind a punch. And the minute it goes to the ice the refs do get involved to stop it. The dangerous parts of hockey are at speed near the boards. A hockey fight is practically tame by comparison to what can happen there.",

If you don&#39;t want to fight you turn your back and that&#39;s it. There are players that fight and players that don&#39;t, and it&#39;s not really a machismo/honor thing that you MUST fight. No one thinks less of you for not being a fighter.\nIf you jump someone who is NOT looking for a fight you are usually going to get tossed from the game and probably suspended for a few games to boot. It&#39;s not OK to blind-side someone who is not likewise spoiling for a fight and generally speaking that is frowned upon.\nSo the minor penalties and general lack of punishment is only in the case of two people who have collaboratively decided to go at it, which is true for almost every fight you see. They are pre-arranged (often at the face-off) and mutually agreed. At that point, two consenting adults doing what they want, basically, and the refs leave it alone until someone is at risk of getting seriously hurt -- usually once someone goes down and it&#39;s no longer a standing fight, or if other people are getting involved, or if one person is effectively incapacitated, etc.\nTo some degree hockey is a self-regulated game. Refs are there for line calls, not necessarily behavior control. 10 people flying around a small ice surface at 40km/h with wooden sticks can REALLY hurt each other while the ref is looking the other way if they want to.\nTo avoid this, fighting is used as a pressure relief... all the pent up aggression you feel for the wrongs and slights done to your team goes into cheering for your guy in the fight. Afterward everyone chills out. This is generally true even if the two guys fighting aren&#39;t the actual guys you were mad at. But the thing is, everyone on your team is going to be mad at someone different for some random thing that happened, so it&#39;s not practical to expect everyone will &quot;pay&quot; individually.\nThis mostly works because most players aren&#39;t assholes. If they do something to earn your ire it was probably by accident or a &quot;one time&quot; thing. It&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ll remember it for more than 5 minutes and unlikely that guy is going to specifically tick you off again. So the fight serves to release the cumulative pressure of all those little things, not necessarily any specific incident.\nWhere this fails is if there is just that one total dick on a team that is constantly cheap-shotting people or otherwise behaving in a douchey way not consistent with the overall tone of the game. Especially if that person keeps doing it even after a fight or two. At some point the other team is going to remember his number and a &quot;generic fight&quot; won&#39;t fix the issue. That guy now has a target painted on his back and at some point -- maybe not even that game but in a future game -- someone is going to risk getting tossed from the game/suspended to teach that specific player a lesson.\nThough usually half of that guy&#39;s own team are just as happy to watch him get creamed because, honestly, he IS a dick. We&#39;d never say it out loud of course, team solidarity, rah rah rah... but at some point people get what they deserve and everyone on both sides knows it.\nEDIT: Others replies here have also made the very good point that I feel worth highlighting... a hockey fight is not like MMA. It&#39;s really hard to get leverage on ice and there&#39;s only so much weight you can get behind a punch. And the minute it goes to the ice the refs do get involved to stop it. The dangerous parts of hockey are at speed near the boards. A hockey fight is practically tame by comparison to what can happen there.</p>\n</div>",

It's just ideal, and opening weekends are the biggest way a movie's success is gauged.\n\nAs for why there seems to be a lot on specific days and the releases aren't more spread out, is because specific times of the year are big hotspots for ticket sales.

It requires a grace period to reengage your metabolism; increasing bloodrate, consuming more nutrients, higher activity, etc. This all takes a while, and trying to kickstart your body into a faster metabolism requires the activation of hormones (like jogging a lap or drinking caffeine). Naturally, this puts you in a mood where you are simply focused on increasing your metabolism in a steady rate, instead of jumping into fun and/or intensive activities.\n\nAnother angle is that, since you mention \"wake up early\", is that your sleep cycle got cut off. Your sleep cycle starts with lowering your metabolism and slowly increasing it back again; it's final stage is REM (Rapid Eye Movement) and waking up during or after REM gives you the 'freshest' start of a day. Waking up in any other part of the cycle means your body got interupted from precious resting and repair time and you will wake up very groggy, sleepy and will most definitely have no desire to go visit a themepark or take that jog.\n",

        "body": "Earth has an atmosphere scattering light. If something is in a shadow, there's always some light coming from the blue sky to light it up. That also creates a slight color difference where direct sunlight looks yellow and shadows look blue. Shadows are a little fuzzy because the Sun has a diameter of 0.5\u00b0 as seen from here. Things look hazy or foggy in the distance. There are all these changes in colors as you approach sunset and then twilight. This is what we're used to, and also what we recognize in pictures of Earth from space.\n\nSaturn doesn't have much of this. It's basically an opaque ball. Almost all of what you see is a direct reflection of sunlight or well approximated by that model. If a part of Saturn is blocked by its rings or vice versa, the resulting shadows are 10 times as sharp as we're used to because Saturn's orbit is that much farther from the Sun. They're also very stark (instant black) because there's no atmosphere that's translucent to enough of a depth to smooth much light over them.\n\nIt so happens that basic CGI lighting models look just like this. The simplest only compute direct light from point lights. If they have shadows, those are very sharp.\n\nSaturn does have one nice exception, which is that [its rings scatter light onto its dark side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#/media/File:Saturn_from_Cassini_Orbiter_%282007-01-19%29.jpg). Try [an eclipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn#/media/File:Saturn_eclipse.jpg) for an eerie view that seems unreal because of how good it is.\n\nEdit: I should say you can definitely see a bit of atmosphere. It looks bluish much like Earth's. Just still not too obvious at the scales we view it at. The same would actually be true for pictures of Earth from high orbits.

Your body changes.  And it's actually an un-pegged value, we'd also need your height for that to really mean anything. You're likely fat ([That is, if you're under 6'6\"](https://www.calculateme.com/bmi-calculator/bmi-of-a-220-pound-person)), and that carries some health issues, but it's really not all that bad. And it's completely recoverable. Eat less, exercise more, eat healthier.     If you're under 6', then you're obese and yes, you should lose some weight. \n\nLosing weight as opposed to not being fat in the first place can result in excess skin, which catches some people by surprise. That can be corrected with surgery, but it ain't cheap.  Some people have tight skin and don't notice when they lose weight. \n\nThere's a lot of stuff about metabolism and how hungry you get with losing weight, but I'm not sure how that really works. \n\nEDIT: Oh man, and I started this whole thing to say that if you cripple or lose or limb then [they're working on that](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/73ied3/one_of_the_most_advanced_bionic_arms/).

So, in the center of the cable is a high voltage cable that can be used to power equipment that gets put in the ocean as well.  Because undersea work is super expensive and they want to minimize the amount of stuff that might break, companies want to minimize the amount of equipment that gets buried.

In shallower areas near shore, the cable gets buried using plows so that a ship can't accidentally cut the cable by dropping an anchor on it or something.  As you get farther out to sea where those kinds of events become veeeeeery unlikely, the cable is laid across flat parts of the ocean.  The amplifiers get connected as needed, and eventually everything gets connected up and you have a link across the ocean.

        "body": "Soaps and shampoos have things in them called surfactants. This is what makes them lather. They coat the dirt and oil and then wash off. These also have a tendency to dry out your skin. \n\nYour hair and skin have a certain pH. Shampoo and body wash also have certain pH. Changing the  pH of your hair or skin changes how it feel and acts. For example, your hair is basically a thin strand of protein, coated in tiny translucent scales. When your pH goes higher those scales stand or open up. On a minor scale this makes your hair frizzy, on a major scale its what lets you change the color or curliness of hair permanently. When your oils seep back out and mix with your sweat it creates a protective layer on your skin and hair and rebalances your pH. \n\nAnyone who's bleached or dyed their hair and gotten it on their hands can tell you that your skin on your body and the skin on your scalp react very differently to chemicals. \n\nBecause of all of this, body wash, soap, and shampoo have different  conditioners and use different surfactants for different uses. Shampoos are also made to balance out different \"issues\" with your scalp. There are moisturizing shampoos, thickening shampoos, sensitive scalp shampoos, clarifying(which just means it's strips everything from your hair and are often used to remove build up of product). Higher quality shampoos will be more closely balanced to your natural pH. \n\nThe skin on your body is much rougher than your scalp for the most part and can withstand rougher chemicals and don't generally need to treat any issues unless you have a skin condition. Using a body wash on your hair would be too rough and would strip too much of the natural oils without replacing them. The same goes for face washes. Those will be the most gentle soaps because the skin on your face, neck, and collar are thinner and more sensitive. \n\nAs for the 3-in-1 soaps, there's nothing technically stating you can't use the same soap for all of those uses but those things really tend to be harsh. They tend to be more targeted to men who are low maintenance because it's all in one and its easy. Ultimately  it comes down to what each individual values though.\n\nHope that helped.

These also have a tendency to dry out your skin. </p>\n\n<p>Your hair and skin have a certain pH. Shampoo and body wash also have certain pH. Changing the  pH of your hair or skin changes how it feel and acts. For example, your hair is basically a thin strand of protein, coated in tiny translucent scales. When your pH goes higher those scales stand or open up. On a minor scale this makes your hair frizzy, on a major scale its what lets you change the color or curliness of hair permanently. When your oils seep back out and mix with your sweat it creates a protective layer on your skin and hair and rebalances your pH. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone who&#39;s bleached or dyed their hair and gotten it on their hands can tell you that your skin on your body and the skin on your scalp react very differently to chemicals. </p>\n\n<p>Because of all of this, body wash, soap, and shampoo have different  conditioners and use different surfactants for different uses. Shampoos are also made to balance out different &quot;issues&quot; with your scalp. There are moisturizing shampoos, thickening shampoos, sensitive scalp shampoos, clarifying(which just means it&#39;s strips everything from your hair and are often used to remove build up of product). Higher quality shampoos will be more closely balanced to your natural pH. </p>\n\n<p>The skin on your body is much rougher than your scalp for the most part and can withstand rougher chemicals and don&#39;t generally need to treat any issues unless you have a skin condition.
